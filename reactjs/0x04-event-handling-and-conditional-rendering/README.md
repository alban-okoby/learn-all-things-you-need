# Event Handling & Conditional Rendering

## Focus on :
- Handle user events (clicks, inputChanges ..)
- Render different UI based on state (conditions)

### Event Handing
Recat events are like browser events, but :
- They're writen in **camalCase** (onClick, onChange, onSubmit ...)
- They receive a synthetic event objet as parameter

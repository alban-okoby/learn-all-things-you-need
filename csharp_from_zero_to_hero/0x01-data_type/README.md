# Data Types
**C#** is a strongly-typed language, which means every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value.

### Syntax

`datatType` myVariable = initialisationValue;

#### Exemple 
```c#
int age = 25;
string name = "John";
double salary = 3000.50;
```

### Common data type in C#

- `byte`: 8-bit integer

#### Floating Point Types
- `float`: 32-bit floating point
- `double`: 64-bit floating point
- `decimal`: 128-bit precise decimal (useful for financial calculations)

#### Character and String Types
